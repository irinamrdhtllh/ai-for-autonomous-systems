# AI for Autonomous Systems - Code Repository
This repository contains jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) files used in the IK5127 Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems course.

## Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or newer** installed, then install the required packages by running the command below in your terminal or command prompt.
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib nnfs scikit-learn pillow
```

For Torch and TorchVision, you can install either the CPU-only version or the CUDA-enabled version (depending on whether your laptop/computer supports CUDA).

Install the CPU-only version:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

Or install the CUDA-enabled version (for example, CUDA 12.6):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

For more details, check the PyTorch website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your laptop/computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/irinamrdhtllh/ai-for-autonomous-systems.git
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. Open any of the notebooks (.ipynb) and run the cells step by step.
